This is a list of things that need to be done.
NOTE this is not in order

"main.c"
- parse a command line (remove excess spaces): put in input.c
- get USERNAME, PCNAME, CWD etc for prompt

"execute.c"
 - check status of command and print error if failed?
 - builtin functions (cd etc..)
 - only split command on "correct" spaces 
 - function cd: - relative paths
				- cd with no args go to home

features to add
 - ability to move cursor/edit line
 - history and tab for autocomplete?
 - directory history and easy back and forward movement
 - piping
 - shell scripts?
 - multitasking (dont wait for completion)
 - a more-or-less GUI based folder explorer (text based)
 - wildcards
