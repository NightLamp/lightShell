This is a list of things that need to be done.
NOTE this is not in order

"main.c"
 - start at home directory
 - get if superuser or not and print $ or # accordingly 

"input.c"
 - get double quotes and it expansion working?

"execute.c"
 - check status of command and print error if failed?
 - builtin functions (cd etc..)
		- make exit a builtin fucntion?
 - only split command on "correct" spaces 

features to add
 - move ~ expanding to home to parsing function (in input.c)????
 - ability to move cursor/edit input
 - command history and tab for autocomplete?
 - directory history and easy back and forward movement
 - piping
 - shell scripts?
 - multitasking (dont wait for completion)
 - a more-or-less GUI based folder explorer (text based)
 - wildcards


RESEARCH
 - Read this for keyboard input done manually:

 - look into key events
